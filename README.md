_The current stable version is 0.19.0_

You can generate the data for your own world, including a number of images (heigthmap, biomes, etc.).

For example:

```bash
worldengine world -s 1 -n seed1
```

Worlds are generated using plate simulations, erosion, rain shadows, Holdridge life zones model and plenty of other phenomenons.

The created world can be used for simulating the evolution of a civilization (see project [civs](https://github.com/ftomassetti/civs)).

It is also possible to generate additional maps, for example an ancient looking map:

```bash
worldengine ancient_map -w seed1.world
```

## Manual

The Manual for Worldengine : [http://worldengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://worldengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


Interoperability (Python, Java)
===============================

We would love to see WorldEngine used together with other tools. Worlds generated by WorldEngine can be loaded into python applications using WorldEngine itself as a library. Java applications can instead use [WorldEngine-Java](https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine-java), a java library to load WorldEngine files.

Worlds can be saved using the protobuf format or hdf5, for which there are libraries in several languages. We keep working on supporting more formats and always interested in ways to improve interoperability.

Binary packages
===============

For Windows, Linux and Mac are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine/releases).

Gui
===

An experimental (and limited!) GUI is available as a separate project: [https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine-gui](https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine-gui).

Install
=======

### Using Docker

First, git clone or download the code, then:

```
bin/run_in_docker.sh
```

### Using pip

```
# Currently not yet released on pypi, you may want to still use Lands or WorldSynth
# or alternatively download the source
pip install worldengine
```

### From source code

```
git clone or download the code

# for unit-testing: also clone worldengine-data
git clone git@github.com:Mindwerks/worldengine-data.git ../worldengine-data
nosetest tests
```

### _On Windows_

If you want to install Worldengine on Windows you can read these [instructions](https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine/wiki/Installing-Worldengine-on-Windows).

Executable file is also available under [releases](https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine/releases), but is currently out of date.

Note: you need also a copy of the worldengine src directory in the same folder as the exe.

Dependencies
============

The gui is based on QT, so you will need to install them

Output
======

The program produces a binary format with all the data of the generated world and a set of images. For examples seed 1 produces.

## Elevation Map

## Precipitation Map

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindwerks/worldengine-data/master/images/examples/world_seed_1_precipitation.png)

## Temperature Map

## Biome Map

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindwerks/worldengine-data/master/images/examples/world_seed_1_biome.png)

## Ocean Map

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindwerks/worldengine-data/master/images/examples/world_seed_1_ocean.png)

There are several optional outputs and many options to control the result. The [manual](http://worldengine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is your friend!

Usage
=====

```
worldengine [options] [world|plates|ancient_map|info]
```

For details about all the possible options please refer to the [manual](http://worldengine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

For example these commands:

```python
worldengine -s 4 -n an_example -q 25 -x 2048 -y 2048
```

Produce this output

```

```

Algorithm
=========

The world generation algorithm goes through different phases:
* plates simulation: it is the best way to get proper mountain chains. For this [pyplatec](https://github.com/Mindwerks/pyplatec) is used
* noise techniques are used at different steps
* precipitations are calculated considering latitude and rain shadow effects
* erosion is calculated
* humidity in each zone is calculated
* terrain permeability is calculated
* biome is calculated using the [Holdridge life zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holdridge_life_zones) model

Development
===========

Using virtualenv you can create a sandbox in which to develop.

Python 2
--------

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python worldengine
```

Python 3
--------

```bash
virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python worldengine
```

Distribution
============

We use PyInstaller to wrap everything up into one binary.

This will create a binary located `dist/worldengine` that has all the
required libs necessary to run.

### Linux
Because of the libraries we use, it is best to use their `develop` branch.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.git@develop
pyinstaller --clean -F -n worldengine worldengine/__main__.py
```

### OSX
You'll need to have brew installed, this should give you all the tools you'll need.
```bash
pyinstaller --clean -F -n worldengine worldengine/__main__.py
```
At this time, it doesn't gather everything from protobuf. So you'll need to
copy google/protobuf python to dist/google/protobuf and create __init__.py in
dist/google

### Windows
Turning your Windows into a developer environment is a long and drawn out process.
I'll try to keep this as short as possible and to the point.

Remember, be consistent if you are either win32 or win64 and everything you download
and install is either one or the other, but not both.

You'll want to install msysgit: https://msysgit.github.io/ which will get you
a Linux like environment. After that, clone the repo and install Python 2.7 for
windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ This will get you also pip
which is required for the rest. You'll first need to pip install virtualenv.

The layout is a bit different than in Linux.
```bash
virtualenv venv
venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Numpy install will fail, so you'll need download a pre-compiled wheel file and
install it with pip. http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
numpy‑1.9.2+mkl‑cp27‑none‑win_amd64.whl
Pick one for your arch, 32 or 64.
```bash
venv/Scripts/pip install ../numpy‑1.9.2+mkl‑cp27‑none‑win_amd64.whl
```

Next step is to get pywin32 which are win32api hooks for python, when downloading,
you'll need to pick either 32 or 64-bit otherwise it won't work. You'll also
install it via pip. http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/
```bash
venv/Scripts/pip install ../pywin32-219.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
```

The last step is to get pyinstaller installed and this can be tricky
because as of right now, we have to use a specific revision that "good-enough".
The issue is being tracked here: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1291
```bash
venv/Scripts/pip install git+https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.git@67610f2
venv/Scripts/pyinstaller --clean --console -F -n worldengine worldengine/__main__.py
```

This project is maintained by [Bret Curtis](https://github.com/psi29a) and [Federico Tomassetti](https://github.com/ftomassetti).

All contributions, questions, ideas are more than welcome!
Feel free to open an issue or write in our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/worldengine).

We would like to thank you great people who helped us while working on WorldEngine and the projects from which it was derived:

* [Evan Sampson](https://github.com/esampson) contributed the amazing implementation of the Holdridge life zones model and improved a lot the ancient-looking-map, biome, precipitation and temperature generators. Thanks a million!

* [Ryan](https://github.com/SourceRyan) contributed the Windows binary version and discussed Lands on Reddit bringing a lot of users. Thanks a million!

* [stefan-feltmann](https://github.com/stefan-feltmann) made Lands depends on pillow instead that on PIL (which is deprecated). This could also help when moving to Python 3. Thanks a million!

* [Russell Brinkmann](https://github.com/rbb) helped saving the generation parameters in the generated world (so that we can use it to generate the same world again, for example), improved the command line options and added tracing information (useful for understanding the performance of the various generation steps)

* [Joshua Coppola](https://github.com/pangal) implemented the satellite view. Thanks a lot, it looks gorgeous!

* [Stephan](https://github.com/tcld) made WorldEngine make heavy use of numpy, helping to speed up the generation. He also made world-generation much more reproducible and helped improve compatibility with Python 3.

* [Alex](https://github.com/MM1nd) made things generally run faster and look cleaner by better employing numpy.
