Install
======================

WorldEngine C++ does not require an installation.  You can simply download a release, and execute the application.

Instead, if you wish to build WorldEngine C++ from source, you will need the following:

- CMake
- Python
- C++ Compiler

Using CMake, generate build files, and build the worldengine-cli target. Alternatively, setup batch files have been provided for Windows targets, designed for use using Microsoft Visual Studio, as well as setup bash scripts for Linux targets.
